#A Prototype to Spencer

This is just a basic, plain text Java file that prints a random quote from an array, using a random number generator. I decided to put it up here for educational purposes, so people can learn how to use the Math.random() class. 

To know more about Spencer and what the future app is intended to be, you can check out my blog post [here](http://blog.snazzyham.com/giving).
